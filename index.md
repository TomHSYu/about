I am a third year PhD student in the [Political Economy program](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/fields/political-economics) at the [Stanford GSB](https://tinyurl.com/4ty64ayd).

My research focuses on the interplay between information and political behavior using game theory and cognitive psychology. On the empirical front, I use machine learning, natural language processing, and various causal inference methods to analyze the US politiciansâ€™ legislative behavior.  

Prior to joining GSB, I graduated from Middlebury College in 2016 with a B.A in economics and a minor in political science.
