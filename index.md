I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Political Economy program](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/fields/political-economics) at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/academic-experience/students/tom-hyeon-seok-yu).

My research focuses on the interplay between information and political preference based on game theory and behavioral political economy. On the empirical front, I use machine (reinforcement) learning methods for implementing adaptive experiments and various causal inference methods to analyze survey experiments and observational data on the US Congress.  

During graduate study, I worked on data science problems at [Netflix](https://research.netflix.com/research-area/experimentation-and-causal-inference). I received my masters in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/graduate-programs/statistics-ms) at Stanford in 2023, where I focused on causal inference methods for observational panel data, experimental design, and stochastic processes.  

Prior to joining GSB, I worked at [Analysis Group](https://www.analysisgroup.com/). I graduated from Middlebury College in 2016 with a B.A in economics and a minor in political science.
