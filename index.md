I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Political Economy program](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/fields/political-economics) at the [Stanford Graduate School of Business](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/academic-experience/students/tom-hyeon-seok-yu).

My research focuses on the interplay between information and political behavior based on game theory and behavioral political economy. On the empirical front, I use machine learning, natural language processing, and various causal inference methods to analyze the US politiciansâ€™ legislative behavior.  

Prior to joining GSB, I worked at an economic consulting firm (Analysis Group). I graduated from Middlebury College in 2016 with a B.A in economics and a minor in political science.
