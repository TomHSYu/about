***"Rational flâneur (or just flâneur): Someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision opportunistically at every step to revise his schedule (or his destination) so he can imbibe things based on new information obtained. In research and entrepreneurship, being a flâneur is called 'looking for optionality.'"*** - Nassim Taleb, *"Antifragile"*

This is a personal commitment device for the continued consumption of content relevant to data science practitioners/researchers and for honing the craft of writing.
