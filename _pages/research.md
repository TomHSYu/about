+ <span style = "color: steelblue"> Predicting Roll Call Votes using Machine Learning Methods</span> with *Floyd Jiuyun Zhang* (Last Update: December 2021) [PDF](/about/files/MachineLearning_2021.pdf){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--small}
    <details><summary style="font-size:75%;"><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    <blockquote style="font-size:75%;"> We present an approach for predicting roll-call votes in the U.S. Congress, using bill text word embedding as well as bill and Congress member characteristics as inputs. Various prediction models are implemented, tested and finally combined using ensemble stacking. Our methods yield higher accuracy than existing methods, especially for newly elected members of Congress.

+ <span style = "color: steelblue"> Electoral Insecurity & Federal Spending Procurement: Causal Inference with Panel Matching and Synthetic Control Methods </span> (Last Update: December 2021) [PDF](/about/files/SyntheticControl_2021.pdf){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--small}
    <details><summary style="font-size:75%;"><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    <blockquote style="font-size:75%;"> How do legislators respond, if at all, to changes in their electoral prospects? Most existing studies adopt a difference-in-differences design that exploits redistricting as an exogenous shock to estimate the causal effect of electoral insecurity on legislators’ federal spending procurement for their districts. This project employs matching and synthetic control methods that produce more comparable counterfactuals to derive the causal estimate of interest. Nearly all matching and SC methods yield improved covariate balance. In addition, these methods return mostly null results while the conventional difference-in-differences method returns statistically significant results, which suggests the importance of ensuring comparability of treatment and control groups. Finally, a negative outcome analysis is conducted to compare the performance of different synthetic control methods.

+ <span style = "color: steelblue"> Analyzing the U.S. Federal Legislation Texts: A Deep Learning Approach </span> with *Hyoungju Seo* (Last Update: May 2019) [PDF](/about/files/DeepLearning_2019.pdf){: .btn .btn--warning .btn--small}
    <details><summary style="font-size:75%;"><b>Abstract</b></summary>
    <blockquote style="font-size:75%;"> This paper analyzes the U.S. federal bill preamble texts from 1973 to 2018 using various embedding and supervised classification methods to gauge the degree of partisanship among bills. In addition to nine different baseline methods from the literature, we develop and implement a CNN-LSTM architecture with a characterbased word embedding model. We find that word-based embedding methods outperform  character-based ones and that a single-layer LSTM outperforms all other architectures tested. Comparing the prediction accuracy over time reveals a (small) positive correlation with individual legislators’ ideological data, suggesting a comparatively lower degree of partisan divide in bill preamble language. Finally, applying the trained LSTM model to a separate political ideology dataset shows a moderate degree of transferability.
